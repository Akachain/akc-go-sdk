#    Ledger section - ledger configuration encompasses both the blockchain
#    and the state
#    This is a part of https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/sampleconfig/core.yaml
#    We use Viper to get configuration from this file so it is available to 
#    other components in Fabric

  state:
    # stateDatabase - options are "goleveldb", "CouchDB"
    # goleveldb - default state database stored in goleveldb.

       # It is recommended to run CouchDB on the same server as the peer, and
       # not map the CouchDB container port to a server port in docker-compose.

       # CouchDB client (on the peer) and server.

       # during start up (eg CORE_LEDGER_STATE_COUCHDBCONFIG_PASSWORD).

       # to prevent unintended users from discovering the password.

       # To disable the cache, 0 MB needs to be assigned to the cacheSize.
